| Hi! I see that you have some variables saved in your workspace. To
| keep things running smoothly, I recommend you clean up before
| starting swirl.

| Type ls() to see a list of the variables in your workspace. Then,
| type rm(list=ls()) to clear your workspace.

| Type swirl() when you are ready to begin.
